# Development of Trajectory Based Control of Supernumerary Robotic Limbs for Assembling Tasks
In this project, a control strategy of Supernumerary Robot Limbs (SRLs) based on trajectory generating is developed for an assembling task.This method is autonomous and could achieve high efficiency without the prerequisite of demonstration data or complex physical models.
